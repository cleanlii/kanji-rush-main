# (A)Sync-Competitive Kanji-Learning Game
- Kanji Rush is a prototype game that provides **two** distinct competitive kanji-learning modes, incorporating asynchronous e-learning (Hrastinski, 2008) and multiplayer gameplay theories (Bogost, 2004).
- The primary goal is to identify the fundamental differences between these two gameplay and seek patterns that can be applied more broadly.
- It also serves as a platform for further discussions in similar contexts.

# Distinct "Goals"

### Async Mode: Who Is Richer?
- Global Clock as a persistent state (Bogost, 2004)
- Long-term, **get points as many as you can in certain time**
- The player will be interrupted **only** when time is up
- Mainly focus on knowledge base (Fan, 2017), fragmented time use(Neto, 2020), strategies (Featherstone, 2017), etc.

### Sync Mode: Who Is Faster?
- No Global Clock
- Short-term, **get certain points as soon as possible**
- The player will be interrupted when the other got enough points
- Mainly focus on real-time competition, retrieval efficiency, improvisational answering skills (Hrastinski, 2008), etc.
